# brakingtests_railways
This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing and visualizing standardized braking test performance in railway systems. The tool processes CSV data from braking tests, calculates key parameters according to industry standards (GMRT2045), and generates visual representations of test results 

## Features:
- Automatic processing of multiple CSV test files
- Calculation of critical braking parameters (distances, velocities)
- Statistical analysis of test dispersion
- Visualization of results against standard requirements
- Support for different braking systems (B7 and EB in EMUs)

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib
